# Moll-E: An AI Personal Assistant

## Overview
Inspired by movies like Iron Man and the desire to have an intelligent home assistant, we were passionate about taking this fictional technology into reality.Utilizing several AI models, we are able to dynamically record speech inputs, convert it to text, analyze the intent, and run commands based
on the intention. For example, simple greetings are handled through the a simple chat bot while complex questions utilize AI search. Personal
information can be stored on a databases and remembered, and events such as commands or alerts can be run using voice command. This Participated in 
and won 1st place in the Crimson Code hackathon, hosted by WSU, SEL, and Major League Hacking.

Features:

* Speech to Text
* Intent recognition and translation
* Appropriate respone
* Text to speech vocalization

### Built With

This section below contains the major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap our project.

* Python
